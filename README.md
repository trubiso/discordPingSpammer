# Discord Ping Spammer
 Spams Discord's ping sound (or whatever sound you'd like it to spam)
 
# Usage
 First clone the repository.

 `git clone https://github.com/trubiso/discordPingSpammer.git`

 Then, simply, open the program and specify a notification sound (notif.mp3 is the Discord ping sound)

 `py main.py <filename>`

 You can configure the interval inside main.py (in the `while true` function, you can change the values and tweak around)
